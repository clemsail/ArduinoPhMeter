# ArduinoPhMeter
For this project , that is build up a Arduino base PH meter for monitor PH , Water Temperature and Room Temperature.
Hardware that you should need is :
  -  Arduino UNO R3
  -  LCD Keypad Shield
  -  PH Meter Board
  -  3D Printed Case

Feature :
  - Show real time PH reading , Room and Water Temperature
  - Use keypad for enter "Calibration Mode" for read the PH reading for PH calibration
  - Serial Port communication via Arduino UNO USB port , send command to UNO for get back the PH and Temperature readings.
  - use mysensor to send data info
  - use eeprom to store data of calibration
  - use peristatic pump to add ph up/down
